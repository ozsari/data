# Spotify API

To use Spotify's API, you first need to create an app. Here's how:

1. Log in with your Spotify account at https://developer.spotify.com/.
2. Then go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and create an app.
3. Fill in the required information such as App Name and App Description. You can choose any name you like. For the Redirect URL, you can use https://example.org/callback as shown in the example.
4. Once you complete these steps and click "Create App," you will be given a client ID and a client secret.
5. Paste these two pieces of information into the appropriate place in the .env file.
6. Create a virtual environment in Python: python3 -m venv .venv
7. Activate the virtual environment: source .venv/bin/activate
8. Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
9. Finally, run streamlit run app.py to access the Streamlit dashboard.
